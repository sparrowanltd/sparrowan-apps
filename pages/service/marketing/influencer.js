                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">What is Influencer Marketing?</h1>
                <p>
                    Influencer marketing is a marketing strategy that involves partnering with individuals who have a significant following on social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. These individuals, known as influencers, can help you promote your products or services to their audience, which can lead to increased visibility and sales.
                    <br />
                    Influencers can come from a wide range of backgrounds and niches, including fashion, beauty, fitness, travel, and more. What they all have in common is a large and engaged following who trust their recommendations and opinions. By partnering with the right influencer, you can tap into this trust and reach a wider audience than you might be able to on your own.

                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Why Does Influencer Marketing Matter?</h1>
                <p>
                    Influencer marketing is becoming increasingly popular because it works. Consumers today are bombarded with advertising messages from every angle, and it can be challenging to cut through the noise. However, influencer marketing is a way to reach consumers in a more authentic and organic way.

                    <br />
                    When an influencer promotes your product or service, they do so in a way that feels genuine and relatable. Their audience is more likely to trust their recommendations because they view the influencer as a peer, rather than a salesperson. As a result, influencer marketing can lead to increased brand awareness, engagement, and ultimately, sales.
