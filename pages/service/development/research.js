                <span className="text-[#FF6B00]">""</span> R&D refers to the process of researching and developing new products, services, or technologies. It involves identifying customer needs and developing solutions to meet those needs. R&D can be divided into two categories: basic research and applied research.
                Basic research is focused on the creation of new knowledge without a specific practical application in mind. It is often conducted by universities and research institutions and can take years or even decades to yield practical results. Applied research, on the other hand, is focused on developing practical applications of existing knowledge. It is often conducted by companies and government agencies to develop new products and services.
