                <span className="text-[#FF6B00]">""</span>Paid Marketing Strategy, also known as Pay-per-Click (PPC) advertising, is a type of digital marketing where businesses pay to have their ads displayed to their target audience. When someone clicks on an ad, the business pays a fee to the platform that hosts the ad. The goal of paid marketing is to drive traffic to your website, increase leads, and ultimately, boost sales.

                Paid Marketing Strategy can be a highly effective way to reach your target audience and drive traffic to your website. It is also cost-effective because you only pay when someone clicks on your ad. This means that you can set a budget for your campaign and only pay for the clicks that you receive. With the right strategy and execution, Paid Marketing can yield significant results for your business.
